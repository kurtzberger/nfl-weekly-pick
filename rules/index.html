				<h2>Scoring</h2>
				<p>
					The scoring for this league will follow <u><b>two separate</b></u> scoring systems and will be tracked separately.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first scoring system is the "Straight-Up Weekly Ranked Pick 'em" format. That is, each week, along with picking each team you predict to win,
					you will also rank each game 1 to the number of games played that week. For example, if there are 16 games to be played for that week, you will rank those games 1 
					through 16. Please note that "Straight-Up" means the spread is <b>NOT</b> a factor in determining if your pick was correct or not.
					You only have to worry about picking the winner of each game. Note: if a game ends in a tie, the corresponding pick is marked incorrect.
				</p>
				<p>
					Upon completion of a game*, if your prediction was correct, you will <b>receive</b> points equal to the rank that you assigned for the corresponding game;
					however, if your prediction was incorrect, you will <b>lose</b> those points. Because of this, it is recommended to rank games you are more confident with a higher
					point value	and rank games you are either unsure of or attempting to pick an upset with a lower point value. Please note: your season starting score will be 0, 
					but there is no minimum score, meaning it is possible for your score to drop below zero.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second scoring system is "Straight-up Weekly (Unranked) Pick 'em". That is, all games are weighted equally, and a correct pick will award you 1 win.
					An incorrect pick awards you nothing and does not affect your score in this scoring system.
					Note: if a game ends in a tie, the corresponding pick is marked incorrect.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div style="border-bottom: thin solid #d0d0d0;">
				<h2>Tiebreaker</h2>
				<p>
					In the event that two or more players have the same amount of points, the tiebreaker will go to the player who has the higher win percentage.
					Win percentage is calculated by the player's correctly predicted games divided by the number of completed games.
				</p>
				<p>
					$$ winPercent = {numberOfWins \over numberOfCompleteGames} $$
				</p>
			</div>
			<div style="border-bottom: thin solid #d0d0d0;">
				<h2>Missed Picks & Unassigned Points</h2>
				<p class="flow-text">
					Any pick(s) that were not made prior to game time will be marked as incorrect at completion of that game. The corresponding unassigned point(s)
					will be subtracted from your point total.
				</p>
				<p class="flow-text">
					For example: In a week with 15 games played, two picks were left unmade. The two unassigned points were 5 and 1 for a total of 6 unassigned points.
					After calculating the score (using the rules stated above), those 6 points will be subtracted from the total.

						<h2>Making Your Picks</h2>
						<p>
							To make your picks, click the menu button (Navigation Menu) in the upper right corner. In the navigation menu, select "Your Picks". The page loaded will be the
							current NFL week; however, use the "Week" dropdown menu to select a different week.
						</p>
						<p>
							After navigating to the desired week, a table will be loaded containing all NFL games of that week. Any picks that you have already
							submitted will be loaded into the table as well.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you are a desktop user, you may either drag and drop with your mouse or use the "Move Up/Down" buttons to reorder your picks.
							If you are a mobile user, you will need to use the "Move Up/Down" buttons to reorder your picks.
							The "Rank" number on the left represents the number of points you are assigning to that game. Click or tap on the left/right of the toggle switch
							to choose either the home or away team as your pick.
						</p>
						<p>
							Reference the following animations.

				<h2>Submitting Your Picks</h2>
				<p>
					Use the submit button at the bottom of the page to submit your picks. An error message will be displayed if something went wrong, otherwise "Picks successfully
					submitted and saved!" will be displayed. When the latter message is displayed, it is safe to navigate away from the web page. If you have made changes to your picks
					and attempt to navigate away before submitting the picks, the web page will display a warning that changes you made have not been saved. This is your only warning that 
					changes have not been saved.

						<h2>Pick Deadlines</h2>
						<p>
							Picks may be changed and resubmitted as often as you'd like; however, picks will be locked within 10 seconds after kickoff.
							The kickoff date and time for each game is listed under the "Kickoff" column. After this time, any picks that have been locked will not be able to be reordered.
							Any remaining picks that are not locked can still be sorted, but will skip over any locked picks.

							Depending on your device (mobile or desktop), the information displayed will vary. If you are a desktop user, all NFL games and user's picks will be displayed
							in a single table. If you are a mobile user, all NFL games will be displayed in a table (top), and players' scores for that week will be displayed in another table
							(bottom). To view others' picks, tap on the row corresponding to the NFL game. This displays a pop-up with all picks corresponding to that game.
						</p>
						<p>
							All picks, other than your own, will be hidden until kickoff. This is to prevent other players from seeing each other's picks before the picks are locked.
